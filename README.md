# Dart reduce() method and Empty Lists

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `reduce()` method in Dart with an empty list. The `reduce()` method requires at least one element in the list; otherwise, it throws a `NoSuchMethodError`. 

The `bug.dart` file shows the error, while `bugSolution.dart` provides a solution using error handling to prevent the exception.

This example is helpful in understanding how to handle potential errors when working with lists in Dart and emphasizing the importance of robust error handling.
